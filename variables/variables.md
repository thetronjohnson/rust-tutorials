# Variables

keyword: let

In rust by by default all variables are immutable by default
This is because Rust was developed with safety in mind

A variable can be made mutable by explicitly adding the keyword mut in front of the variable

# Constants

keyword: const

Constants are always immutable

# Shadowing

You can declare a new variable with the same name as the old variable
ie first variable is shadowed by the second

Shadowing is useful because we are not allowed to mutate a variable's type
